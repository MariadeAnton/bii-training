Ptypes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lasote/ptypes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lasote/ptypes)
======

PTypes is a simple alternative to the STL that includes multithreading and networking. It defines dynamic strings, character sets, lists and other basic data types along with threads, synchronization primitives, named pipes and IP sockets. You can find documentation and examples in the [github repo](https://github.com/lasote/ptypes/tree/master/doc).

This is an adaptation from the original Hovik Melikyan ptypes library due to be incorporated to biicode.com
The original software can be found in the author's website: http://www.melikyan.com/ptypes/
